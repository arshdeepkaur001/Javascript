I am a recent graduate in Computer Science and Engineering, equipped with a strong academic foundation and a passion for technology. My education has provided me with a comprehensive understanding of computer science principles, programming languages, and software development methodologies.

Throughout my journey, I have developed a robust skill set that includes proficiency in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), JavaScript, HTML, CSS, MongoDB, MySQL, React, Node.js, Flutter, and Bootstrap. My technical expertise is complemented by excellent communication skills, a keen eye for design, and the ability to create user-friendly and visually appealing websites and applications. Additionally, I have a natural inclination toward leadership and management roles, which allows me to thrive in collaborative environments and guide projects to successful completion.

During my internship at iHub AWaDH, IIT Ropar, I had the opportunity to work extensively with Flutter. This experience enabled me to refine my skills in front-end development and design while working on diverse projects that emphasized creating intuitive and engaging user interfaces. The internship provided me with practical experience and a deeper understanding of the development process, further solidifying my passion for front-end development.

Looking ahead, I am eager to embark on my professional journey and secure my first job in the field of web development.
